# 1. Music and Sound: 

## 1.1: Basic Properties of Sound

### I.1.1: Physical Properties: 

Frequency: rate of periodic pressure change, measured in Hz
-- Human hearing: 17 Hz - 17 kHz

Intensity: strength of pressure fluctuations
-- Decibels: 40 dB - 120 dB

Onset: time when the sound begins
Duration: length of time we can hear a sound 
-- Measured in seconds

Envelope: Characteristic way in which the intensity of a sound changes through time

Waveshape: 
-- Our hearing uses the shape of sound waves to characterize sound quality

### 1.1.2: Perception of Sound

## 1.2: Waves

Wave: an organized traveling disturbance in a medium (such as air)
-- the medium does not flow, the disturbance in the medium travels through the medium
*** Waves transmit energy without transmitting matter

### 1.2.1: Wave Shape: 

### 1.2.4: Sine and Sinusoid: 

Sinusoidal motion is simple harmonic motion

Sinusoidal: 
Sine motion is a mathematical abstraction of simple harmonic motion, just as a point is a geometrical abstraction of a location in space. We can make an ink dot on a piece of paper and say it represents a geometrical point; similarly, a particular sinusoidal motion can be said to represent sine motion. But both sine motion and geometrical point really exist only in our minds, and the sinusoid and ink dot are their real-world counterparts.


### 1.2.5: Conservative and Nonconservative Forces: 
Damping: the effect of energy dissipation on a vibrating system

Conservative: operate within the system to perpetuate vibration

Nonconservative: operate between the system and its surroundings to dissipate energy through friction and radiate energy through heat and sound
